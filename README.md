# learn-haskell

### What's this

My codes for course [CIS194](https://www.seas.upenn.edu/~cis194/spring13/lectures.html), including the example codes and assignments.

The slides of CIS194 was translated by me at [my blog](https://blackcloud37.tech) (Doing)

**Finished chapters**

* [Week1](https://blackcloud37.tech/posts/fb3ef408/)

### How to use

The whole project was created by [Haskell Stack](https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/README/), so you should install haskell stack first.

Homework of each week will be placed in the dir  `./src` and named `Week<n>.hs`, import them in the `Main.hs` and use `stack run` in terminal(or cmd) to run it.
