# learn-haskell

### What's this

My codes for course [CIS194](https://www.seas.upenn.edu/~cis194/spring13/lectures.html), including the example codes and assignments.

The slides of CIS194 was translated by me at [my blog](https://blackcloud37.tech) (Doing)

### How to use

The whole project was created by [Haskell Stack](https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/README/), so you should install haskell stack first.

Assignments of each week will be placed in the dir  `./src` and named `Week<n>.hs`, but the testing code was not finished yet, so you may just read my implementions

If you have better solution, welcome to give me issues! Thanks a lot :p
